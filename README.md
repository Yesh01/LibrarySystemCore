# Java SQL Connectivity Project

## Description

This project is part of a learning journey focused on mastering **Java** and **database connectivity using SQL**. As a student developer, the primary goal is to explore the fundamentals of connecting Java code with SQL databases **without relying on GUI tools** like MySQL Workbench.

### Project Highlights:

- **Core Java**: This project is implemented without any graphical user interface (UI).
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: Focuses on direct database operations through Java code.
- **SQL**: The project explores essential SQL queries and interactions with a database.
- **Learning-Oriented**: Designed as a reconstruction of a university lab project, the emphasis is on reinforcing core concepts related to database connectivity and SQL through Java.

### Objectives:

1. Build familiarity with Java-to-SQL connectivity.
2. Implement database operations using **SQL** without a UI tool.
3. Enhance understanding of **JDBC** and database functionality within Java.
4. Practice creating a fully functional core project using pure Java.
